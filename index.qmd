## Welcome

- AI tools are transforming academic research
- Especially relevant for data science, fisheries, remote sensing, and econometrics
- This presentation covers key tools and applications


## AI can help with each stage of the research process

1. Idea generation
2. Literature review
3. Data analysis
4. Writing and communication
5. Collaboration and project management

## A bit on different LLM options
- **Google's Gemini**
  - General purpose, good for lit review, idea generation, etc
  - Excellent data privacy protections through UCSB license

- **Anthropic's Claude**
  - Excellent for coding
  - Direct agentic integration with your IDE

- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Designed for coding, integration with your IDE and Github
  - Can use many LLM backends (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.)

## Data privacy

- Always check the data privacy policies of any AI tool you use
- UCSB's Gemini license has excellent protections
    - [Approved for P1/P2/P3/P4 sensitive data](https://cio.ucsb.edu/artificial-intelligence/genai-tools-ucsb)
    - Your data is not used to train models
    - Available for faculty and staff
- Claude Code has [settings](https://privacy.claude.com/en/collections/10672565-data-handling-retention) for data retention, whether your code is used to train models, etc

## Research process: Idea Generation

- Gemini, Claude, GPT
- Gemini Deep Research

## Research process: Literature Review

- Google Scholar Labs
- Gemini Deep Research
- Gemini Notebook LM
- Specialized tools: Research Rabbit, Nature Research Assistant, Elicit, Consensus

## Research process: Data analysis with coding Assistants

**GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Positron Assistant, Positron Databot**

- Integrated directly into your IDE
- Have access to your codebase, file structure
- Code generation (great for R, Python, etc)
- Can be used in 'ask', 'edit', or 'agent' mode
- Can run commands (if you let it)
- Great for data science workflows
- Can even be used for machine learning model development

## Research process: Writing and Communication

- Gemini, Claude, GPT
- Gemini Nano Banana for image generation
- Specialized tools: Research Rabbit, Nature Research Assistant, Elicit, Consensus

## Getting Started

**Recommended First Steps:**

1. Try Gemini for literature summaries
2. Become familiar with GitHub Copilot
3. Try a Claude or GitHub Copilot coding assistent in your IDE

## Resources

- [Free Copilot course from GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184217)
- [Getting started with Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

## Best Practices

1. **Verify** AI-generated content - *keep a human in the loop*
2. **Remain** accountable
3. **Cite** usage appropriately
4. **Check** sources
5. **Maintain** data privacy
6. **Document** your workflow
7. **Stay** critical, skeptical, and curious

## Thanks!
