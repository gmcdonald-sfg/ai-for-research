## Welcome

- AI tools are transforming academic research
- Especially relevant for data science, fisheries, remote sensing, and econometrics
- This presentation covers key tools and applications


## AI can help with each stage of the research process

1. Idea generation
2. Literature review
3. Data analysis
4. Writing and communication
5. Collaboration and project management

## A bit on different LLM options
- **Google's Gemini**
  - Good general purpose LLM for lit review, idea generation, etc
  - Excellent data privacy protections through UCSB license
    - [Approved for P1/P2/P3/P4 sensitive data](https://cio.ucsb.edu/artificial-intelligence/genai-tools-ucsb)
    - Your data is not used to train models
    - Available for faculty and staff
- **Anthropic's Claude**
  - Excellent for coding
  - Direct agentic integration with your IDE
- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Excellent for coding
  - Built in functionality for GitHub platform
  - Can use many LLM backends (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.)

## Coding Assistants

**GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Positron Assistant, Positron Databot**

- Code generation (great for R, Python, etc)
- Data science workflows
- Machine learning model development

## Literature Review

**Elicit, Consensus, Research Rabbit**

- Systematic literature searches
- Paper summarization
- Citation networks
- Finding relevant studies

## Data Analysis Tools

**AI-Enhanced Analytics**

- Automated EDA
- Pattern detection in remote sensing data
- Time series forecasting
- Spatial analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Verify** AI-generated content - *keep a human in the loop*
2. **Remain** accountable
3. **Cite** usage appropriately
4. **Check** sources
5. **Maintain** data privacy
6. **Document** your workflow
7. **Stay** critical, skeptical, and curious

## Getting Started

**Recommended First Steps:**

1. Try Gemini for literature summaries
2. Try making a Gemini Gem for a common task you have
3. Become familiar with GitHub Copilot
4. Try a Claude coding assistent in your IDE

## Resources

- [Free Copilot course from GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184217)
- [Getting started with Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

## Thanks!
