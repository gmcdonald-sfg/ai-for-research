## Welcome

- AI is transforming the way research is done
- AI is *rapidly* evolving - tools and capability changing daily
- Today I'll  focus on tools I've personally used, but this is by no means exhaustive!
- Since tools are changing so rapidly, we'll also talk about best practices
- I'm no AI expert - but an enthuastic (and optimistically skeptical) user
- I also really want to hear from *you*



## AI can help with each stage of the research process

1. Idea generation
2. Literature review
3. Data analysis
4. Writing and communication
5. Collaboration and project management

## A bit on different LLM options
- **Google's Gemini**
  - General purpose, good for lit review, idea generation, etc
  - Excellent data privacy protections through UCSB license

- **Anthropic's Claude**
  - Excellent for coding
  - Direct agentic integration with your IDE

- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Designed for coding, integration with your IDE and Github
  - Can use many LLM backends (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.)

## Data privacy

- Always check the data privacy policies of any AI tool you use
- UCSB's Gemini license has excellent protections
    - [Approved for P1/P2/P3/P4 sensitive data](https://cio.ucsb.edu/artificial-intelligence/genai-tools-ucsb)
    - Your data is not used to train models
    - Available for faculty and staff
- Claude Code has [settings](https://privacy.claude.com/en/collections/10672565-data-handling-retention) for data retention, whether your code is used to train models, etc

## Research process: Idea Generation

- Gemini, Claude, GPT
- Gemini Deep Research

## Research process: Literature Review

- Google Scholar Labs
- Gemini Deep Research
- Gemini Notebook LM
- Specialized tools: Research Rabbit, Nature Research Assistant, Elicit, Consensus

## Research process: Data analysis

**Coding agents: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Positron Assistant, Positron Databot**

- Integrated directly into your IDE
- Have access to your codebase, file structure
- Code generation (great for R, Python, etc)
- Can be used in 'ask', 'edit', or 'agent' mode
- Can run commands (if you let it)
- Great for data science workflows
- Can even be used for machine learning model development

## Positron Databot


- Developed by **Posit** team (formerly R Studio) for **Positron** (modern, polyglot IDE alternative to RStudio based on VS Code)
- Allows you to interact with your data using natural language
- Can be used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization
- Designed with responsible, human-in-the-loop use in mind ([Databot is not a flotation device](https://posit.co/blog/databot-is-not-a-flotation-device/))


> "In my 30-year career writing software professionally, Databot is both the most exciting software I've worked on, and also the most dangerous."
>
> –Joe Cheng, Posit CTO

> To use Databot effectively and safely, you still need the skills of a data scientist.

> Databot is a set of fins that can make you swim faster and stronger, not a life vest.

## Positron Assistant
- Developed by **Posit** team for **Positron**
- A general coding assistant that can help with a wide range of coding tasks
- Can be used for code generation, debugging, documentation, and more
- Specifically tailored for data science workflows, with specific R and Python tooling
- Has access to your codebase and file structure, so it can provide more context-aware assistance
- Can use various LLM backends (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) and/or GitHub Copilot


## Research process: Writing and Communication

- Gemini, Claude, GPT
- Gemini Nano Banana for image generation (e.g., schematics)
- Specialized tools: Research Rabbit, Nature Research Assistant, Elicit, Consensus

## Research process: Collaboration and Project Management

- GitHub Copilot for project management and collaboration
  - Can generate issues, pull requests, documentation, etc
  - Can be used to review code and suggest improvements
  - Can help with project organization and workflow

- Various other AI-powered tools in Slack, Asana, Zoom, etc

## Examples

- Vincent Arel-Bundock's [Use LLMs to learn about any chapter of my 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 book, or any function in the `marginaleffects` package for R or Python.](https://bsky.app/profile/vincentab.bsky.social/post/3mequg4gzts27) **(light lift)**
- Pedro Sant'Anna's [Comprehensive Guide to Multi-Agent Slide Development, Code Review, and Research Automation](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html) **(heavy lift)**

*(Thanks for the examples, Robert!)*


## Getting Started

**Recommended First Steps:**

1. Try Gemini for literature summaries
2. Become familiar with GitHub Copilot
3. Try a Positron coding assistent for your next data science task

## Resources

- [Free Copilot course from GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184217)
- [Getting started with Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

## Best Practices

1. **Verify** AI-generated content - *keep a human in the loop*
2. **Remain** accountable
3. **Cite** usage appropriately
4. **Check** sources
5. **Maintain** data privacy
6. **Document** your workflow
7. **Stay** critical, skeptical, and curious

## Thanks!
